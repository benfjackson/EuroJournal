The bus from Budapest to Belgrade was a double decker.
The well-moustached man grunted my ticket up the stairs, however I was lucky enough for the bus to be full enough that I wandered downstairs from the overcrowded overheated upstairs compartment into the luxurious air conditioned cabin downstairs. Over the journey the fortunate who stumbled upon the secret lower cabin all migrated downward, not mentioning to the poor souls sweating upstairs.
Business class streamed by curiousity rather than economics.
It still managed to mostly just be young people downstairs.
