The bus from Budapest to Belgrade was a double decker.
The well-moustached man grunted my ticket up the stairs, however I was lucky enough for the bus to be full enough that I wandered downstairs from the overcrowded overheated upstairs compartment into the luxurious air conditioned cabin downstairs. Over the journey the fortunate who stumbled upon the secret lower cabin all migrated downward, not mentioning to the poor souls sweating upstairs.
Business class streamed by curiousity rather than economics.
It still managed to mostly just be young people downstairs.

I went to a gallery dedicated to the lifes work of a Hungarian mosaic artist. It had some beatiful pieces in it. I like the textures of mosaic art, how golds will flicker as you move your head, making the halos holier.
There was a display of the timeline of his life that ran in parallel to one showing the geopolitical developments of the 1940s. WWII crept up ominously, and eventually the threat of Nazis forced him to close his shop and discontinue his craft. Who knows what wonders he would have created had he not been forced to flee.
It didn't mention how he died.
Historical circumstance picks the great artists. His name was mentioned alongside Gaudi as a pioneer of art Nuveau, but while Gaudi got the contract for the Sagrada familia, all he got was a gold star.

I wish I could have explored the city a bit more, but I was only there for 1 night and crippled. I saw a nice castle and gallery, but would have liked to see other monuments of a dead empire.

The cops here were the least well equipped I saw anywhere - their mismatching police print t shirts looked like theyd all been told to make their own uniform and bring it from home.
However I still saw them harassing lemonade stand ppl and pulling people over - didnt see this anywhere else.
Apparently you get 3 years prison instantly for possession of weed.
So, anything that happens in the next 3 years for me is a blessing and a gift granted to me by good fortune.

Characters.
A german girl who wanted to make friends, she was nice enough and I tried, but she decidedly wasnt Emma.
I didnt ask, but with the amount of vulvic iconography she was wearing, she was definitely a lesbian.
