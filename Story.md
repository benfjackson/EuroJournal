# How have I changed as a person?

Neuroplasticity is the brain's great restlessness.
Never to be idle, the restless desire to learn, to grow, to improve sees any task whatsoever as a worthy foe.
It is our responsibility to continually feed the beast interesting activities, else it shall atrophy into bland stagnancy.

It has been interesting to see which tasks my brain has taken for a muse over the course of the trip.
First and most practically, map reading and directional sense was chosen. I inherited my mothers notoriously poor sense of direction, as I was regularly reminded by my siblings who got from my grandmother a somewhat comical love of discussing optimal routes.
I (proudly) can now project the abstract squiggly blue line google draws across the map for me into the real streets that lay in front of me.

The most interesting intellectual muscle I have had the pleasure of pushing to hypertrophy has been my appreciation of art.
One of the unfortunate side-effects of capitalisms cooption of the education system has been the streamlining of degrees - the factory of singularly STEM educated experts to be turned into professionals.
This obsession with employability robbed me of my right to be educated in the more romantic aspects of study - the arts were forbidden.
My enrolment in two philosophy and a poetry unit were considered illicit, and my degree was only saved by a series of diplomatic emails sent by my eldest sibling.
My exsanguinated education.

So, I have taken my artistic education into my own hands.
I've visited an innumerable amount of arts museums both explicit and implicit about their being a gallery.
See some galleries claim they are a museum, but hidden in the artifacts they display is the undeniable hand of someone who cares deeply about their craft.
Counting/calculating/computing contraptions, crockery collections, curl capped/ columns, all find their own way to be beautiful.

Then one day I saw the spirit of beauty creep from behind the glass that displayed it, under the peering noses of tourists, and out into the world.

It ran away to a small Serbian village to live in the decrepit houses with peeling paint and falling rooves.
It sits in a Berlin median strip, dancing to the songs the bees sing to their flowers.
It lies with a shattered mirror ordered into the shape of a heart.
It concocts the strange and bizarre combinations of

Like Pandora's box, I hope it shall never return to its confines.

When I watch tourists visit a gallery using their phones for, I die a little inside.

The zombies walk around the gallery, seeing all the interesting things through their bionic eye. Tchick tchick tchick, the hunters shoot, recording the kill of another famous rarity they may tick off their list.
I wonder if they ever scrolls through their personal collection of secondary art to experience and feel in retrospect.
I hope at least the phone feels something when its lense turns toward the form of two forbidden lovers scratched out in graphite.

In the same way we have been taught that history is a list of dates to be remembered, and maths a series of formulas to be memorised, art has been taught as a series of paintings to have seen.
