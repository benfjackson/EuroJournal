# La Fromagerie.

Bonjour! A present
je suis
aller a la
fromagerie.

Je ne marche qu'
Une minute
(En France, C'est
en Toutes les rues.)

Le vendeur dit
"Enchant√©
Je'sais ce
que vous voulez"

"Non", j'ai dit.
"Non, Mon dieu"
Dit-Elle, sous choc:
"pourquoi Monsieur?"

Tout le monde entend
Mon cri joyeux
'Le raison est
Je les veux tous!"

Again, Emma and I had a series of very interesting dialogues around various philosphical subjects, covering what she was studying in class, travel, AI, adventuring in the world vs in books, and how projects bring meaning (aka what I should be doing with my life).

I wrote her some poems upon exit.
Its a shame that my favourite art from is unintelligible to her. I must learn French.
