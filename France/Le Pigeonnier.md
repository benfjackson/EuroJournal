Roofs are not made for people to be on. They seperate people sitting safely inside from the tempest of the sky above.

Being on a roof puts you outside the space and time of the normal world, exempt from its busy happenings and binding conventions.
You view the world from a place people normally never venture to, a pigeons perspective that looks down upon the silly little people doing their silly little activities.

In Emmas prescence, I become acutely aware of time's precious scarcity.
For I am to leave. Far across the earth to live under a different sky.

Realisations blade is sharp and merciless.
Suddenly, harshly and mercilessly, it cuts through youth's innocent illusions of immortality, and my life has become finite.
Every croque of time is a delicacy to be savoured with the utmost sincerity.

Relentless and unstoppable, time elapses.
melt across
It drips away over my fingers, unwavering and relentless in its quest to turn each moment into the past.
Cigarettes cannot burn forever.

Fleeting and ephemeral

Moments cannot last forever.
A cigarette can only fit so much tobacco.

I could do anything, but I only want to do this:
Sit by her side, envelop her hands in mine and ask her about her thoughts.
