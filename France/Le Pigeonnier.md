Le Pigeonnier

Rooves are not made for living on,
But for those huddled beneath
To hide from heaven's tempest.

To be on the roof,
hidden from the
outside the world of people,

is to be exempt from the bindings of obligation,
from the busyness of living.

Rooves are not made for feet with toes,
but clawed vagabonds venture where they please.

<!-- To dance across the -->

To dwell atop and see from above
La societé absurde
Is a luxury enjoyed from the air
And by residents of Le Pigionnier

Perched atop a block of

Les pigeons vivent les beaux vies.
Nothing in life is as important
as pecking for tasty morsels
shitting on expensive possessions / shitting where you please
And ascending to the freedom of the sky

<!-- The life of a pigeon is beautiful
et ascension vers la libertie du ciel -->

Below, silly little people perform their silly little lives
and the world becomes cinema. (le monde devient cinéma)

<!-- life is more interesting viewed from above -->

et les yeux du pigeon tout voir.

Pigeons hold great wisdom, <!-- to live on a roof and abstain from society.

<!-- People never venture there. -->

Perched atop

They seperate the people sitting safely inside/protect
from the tempest of the sky.
Shield from the tempest of the heavens. (la tempête du ciel) (wrath)

I am Condemned to Yearn for a Memory.

In Emmas prescence, I become acutely aware of time's precious scarcity.
For I am to leave far across the earth to live under different stars.

Realisation's blade is sharp and merciless.
Suddenly and harshly, it cuts through my youth's innocent illusions of immortality, as I realise my life, and everything in it, has become finite.

Every croque of time is a delicacy to be savoured with the utmost sincerity.
La lumière paints us in gold as we drape eachother in night-shaded nails.

Relentless and unstoppable, time elapses, unwavering and cruel in its quest to send each moment into the realms of history.
To see, to touch, to feel - to be, all become a luxury.
Legs tangle and tongues dance.

I would gladly drink any poison in desperation for a few more shared moments.
So, I become a smoker.
Sharing is the purest intimacy, it is more than a cigarette that we pass between us.

Twisting coils rise from my fingers. Tobacco becomes smoke, and the present becomes the past.

Cigarettes do not burn forever.
But while they do,
We are fucking alive.

---

relentlessly, mercilessly
Eventually they remain only as a burn on the lips and a tingle in the fingers.
Eventually they remain only as ash on the lips and a calmness in the soul.

Fleeting
and ephemeral

As with every moment that has ever happened, I can now only visit it in my memory.
I have condemned myself to a life of yearning.
Theres a certain peace in the anguish of longing.

---

I am to fly from the pigionnier. A homing human, I will journey back in my mind. Back to the comfort of the little room that hangs above the world.

---

Moments cannot last forever.
I am forced into a state of pure being, driven out my mind and into my body.
A cigarette can only fit so much tobacco.

Life promises that I could do anything, but I only want this:
To sit by her side, envelop her hands in mine and listen as she funnels the contents of her mind into the english language,
What a misfortune for her, to have found a stupid foreigner unable to comprehend the musings of her inner french.

timeless night
lumier d'Or
tête d'Or

Our coy little dance, speaking about subjects of emotional import through abstractions and the protection of theoretical musings. Do you want to travel more? Do you like traveling with friends or alone? Where do you want to go? What do you think about love vs relationships? What do you think about

there is no wisdom in french hehehehe
