There is a certain magic about Paris, a disappearing act involving the money in your bank account.

Aurora, Emmas friend, hosted us in her Parisian apartment. She had filled it with art books.

## Dinner at Le Comet

All the Parisian cafes and restaurants were open late, which allowed us to have a nice 11pm dinner at Le Comet.
It was a typically cute Parisian cafe, dripping in warm bulbs and adorned in twirling french script.
We enjoyed a delicious French onion soup and creamy poulet alongside our favourite and usual main course of an intense philosophical discussion.

## Dinner at the Boullion

Together with some friends, we went to a wetherspoons version of a restaurant. Their profit strategy was hitting an economy of scale, churning through customers en masse.
Luckily, french stews scale very, very well.
We hopped in the second queue which stretched around the corner.
All the French (and I followed) of course ordered all 3 courses.
It was packed in with people ok a fremch version of drunklings.

## Chess & picnic at the Louvre

3 of the finest fromages id ever had, a crispily soft delicious baguette and a yummy ass cold rose.
We lounged around the garden of the louvre while Emma and Eliza discussed their philosophy classes. They spoke in English for me, kind and inclusive. Listening to them helped me learn, as they also drew upon our mutual vocabulary.
To speak english to a beginner french person, you musnt speak simply - instead, use the fancy way of talking that has been inherited from their language.
A pendulum game, the two french philosophers blundered their rook in the endgame and I punished

## Art show at l'Ecole de Beaux Arts

A student exhibition, the Parisian students showed off contemporary their contemporary art skills - a series of abstract art under the gaze of the marble statues that decorated their halls from on high.
The next day, Eliza complained that the works of art did not make her think enough.

## Cafe de Flore

5!!!! Euro for an espresso here
Satre and De Beauvoir, we sat and discussed love and relationships (our coy waltz, unacknowledged and straight faced), life goals and the self determination of being a child, while the Americans next to us had a petty argument.

## Musee d'Orsay

Keen to see the impressionist exhibition, Emma, Aurora and I scurried along to the station, where they got in for free while I was stung with the full fee. We had to hurry, for we only had 3 hours to spend at the gallery before our respective tickets to Lyon were scheduled.
Van Gogh's colouring was the star, gorgeously vivid and intense. A self portrait of his looked intense, slightly scared and affronted, as the crowd rotated through its queue of selfie takers each enjoying recording their moment with his fame.

## Walking around Paris

Military wearing bereet - only in France lmao
Streetballers saying oo la la with an attempt at masculinity when their friend pulled out some fancy moves at streetball.
