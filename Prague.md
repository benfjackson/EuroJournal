Despite the large amount of drugs I did in Berlin, this was easily the worst hangover I had - oxytocin comedown mixed with the knowledge I was living inside of a poor decision that had been easily reversible despite me doubling down on it.
Here, I spent the two days I should have spent with Ella.
The main thing I did here was wallow in regret.
I was like a regular tourist, walking around like a zombie, taking thoughtless photos of random things that zinged my photo neurons.
Once again, I learn my lesson that a place is the people.
I went to a park and was caught in the rain. I found a little alcove to shelter under. It was only me and a statue of a naked lady alone in the rain.
The universe has a cruel irony to it.

Travelling is brutal because there are fewer second chances. No slow burns allowed. If you fuck it up theyre fully gone in a different country, no texting the following day.
