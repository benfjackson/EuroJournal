The city is still 750 years young and grew into prosperity because of the dutch east india company.
There were so many gorgeous mansions everywhere - brutal colonial regimes pay good dividends.

The guy who did my walking tour took us to the holocaust monument. There was a brief mention of Indonesia but not a lot of depth. He knew the way the dutch colonialists had treated indonesia was wrong but didnt know a lot more than that. He mentioned a genocide, but implied it was something that happened in the past.
Although he was a historian, I got the vibe that he felt like it was deep in the past.

There was 1 memorial to Indonesia that started out as a momument to a general of the Dutch East India company that was bombed, then re-dedicated as a monument to Indonesia.
There was minimal information on the monument, I had to go to wikipedia to find that the genocides happened at recently as 1947 with Indonesia's independence movement.

It was a very 'nice' place - lots of wealthy people. They live their perfect lives, saying sorry but without action for the horrors that have been caused by Indonesian colonialism.

I rode on the left hand side and got laughed at by a cheeky unit.

Went to this place: Embassy of the free mind.
Was meant to be a safe haven for ideas too radical to be allowed by the state.
Still had gendered toilets tho lmao - stuck in antiquity ass mfs.
Should stop fetishizing the past. It should be used to inform the future, not treated as an isolated thing to be studied.
They had this enormous and gorgeoously decorated holy grail tho.

Sampling the local cuisine

Indonesian food. I got some mie dan sayur sayuran. I was too nervous to speak any real Indonesian but I used a terima kasih and a sampai jumpa. Got no reaction apart from a sama sama from the counter lady though.
She was lovely to another dutch lady who seemed to be her friend.
