I stayed here with my friend Adam. I met him in Edingborough and he invited me to stay with him in his friends van that was parked on their squat.
The land was an abandoned mercedes benz showroom, which now housed large sculptures in its display windows, built from scrap metals and bits and bobs.
Out back 20-30 vans clustered around the spacious parking lot, their dreadlocked dwellers smiling and waving as you rode past. The camp dogs trotted up to you in 3s to say hello and get a little pat.

Adam was a small boy with two pierced ears and background in horticulture (growing flowers.)
He was from Melbourne but spoke like he had watched too much of the Simpsons as a child.
I continued my journey of questioning, beginning this chapter with a pre-warning that I might not want to fuck.
Adam still tried his hardest, but unfortunately he was a lot smaller than I.
We cuddled each night and I could tell in the way he turned his head to me how much he wanted to fuck. Me, I felt nothing.
His skin didnt have the softness given by the female fat distribution, and I could feel his veins in his hands. Maybe small boys just arent my type.
We still had an awesome time riding round the city, wandering indecisively around the grocery store, eating stroopwaffles, canoing through the canals and watching movies in the van.
It was romance without intoxicating oxytocin.

Bar.
The place was decorated with grungy anti capitalist and extremely explicit posters and stickers. Be gay do crime was illustrated before us, a unicorn that was definitely horny.

On wednesday nights the bar opens up to the community with an event. Although there wasn't one this week, there was a communal meal on. For a frillies style donation I got a big and yummy meal - vegan of course.
The music played there sounded like the aux cord had a poor connection or the bluetooth connection had distruption. Then I noticed the noise had a rhythm to it, and wasn't just the ambient growl of industrial machinery.

Gym
They had a gym which mainly focused around boxing bags and floor mats.
It had a massive antifa banner on the walls.
I hit a massive set of curls here.

SpielKlok museum.
Ahh, to be a dutch clockmaker. Little round glasses and smile etched into your face.
They had these stamp cards that you could punch so when you fed it into the music and wound it it would play your tune. I managed to make the little dutch spielklok sing us bad romance by lady gaga.
There were also enormous music cars they apparently used to park up on the street and charge people to dance to.
