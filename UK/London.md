## Jeanie's

Staying at Jeanies friends place was sooo cozy. Cute English flat with a magical garden. Had few rooms and a living/dining situation too. Showed how a nice cosy space comes from the effort you put into it, not the space it was.
Was in the middle of a Jewish community. Meant when we came home on Fri night we heard families singing rather than house parties
Stayed out til 6 on Sat night at Dalston superstore ;)

## Tate Modern

Very busy and dogshit lighting.
Had some wonderful pieces

Interesting to see how they actively seek alternate tellings of history.

Went very well with Koyaniskatsi.
Ominous hanging chess pieces looking down at you with power.

Mari Katayama
Seamstress who lost her legs at a young age.
Stitched herself a jacket made of arms
Great exhibition about bodies and beauty.
bodies do not need to conform to social norms to be beautiful.
She took self portraits in her room.
Places people care for are incredibly cosy.

## Shakespeare's globe

Saw Richard III live. The cast was all women - like inverse 1500s Shakespeare.
Snuck in a few references to contemporary politics.
Had a gradient of costumes from shakespears time through to a modern suit.

## Science Museums

Only European museum that acknowledged that the wonders within were funded by slavery.

I saw a bunch of early computers at the science museum. They were all fullstack machines - they were set up to calculate 1 thing and 1 thing only. Clearly whoever designed them had not been taught the BASIC principles of software engineering.

Standing next to the skeletons of dinosaurs was awe inspiring. We are just little monkeys. All the types of hominoid skulls were crazy too. Interesting to see the facial reconstructions - they all look like normal people.

## Serpentine I - colonial gallery

Filled with books - each corresponded to a war fought because of colonialism. It contained a bunch in Australia that the Aus education system had neglected to mention to me.

## Serpentine II - feminist gallery

Had a section of striking pieces about giving birth - an incredibly sacred and important part of the human experience that has 0 coverage in art because men have controlled art.
The crowning - when a child is born and the top of their head pokes through into the world, crowned by their mother.

# Brick lane

I was instantly picked out by the headhunters as a drug user. They gave me a business card and told me they could sell me anything. Very professional young men, their colleagues picked me up in their car, we made a business deal then I went on my merry way. Hung out with some models & only fans girlies for the evening. He made me take his insta "if I ever need anything in London"

Everyone was well dressed, but noone was outrageously cunty.
Everyone seemed hyper aware of their appearance.
A guy with the same hair as me went into the bathroom to wet his hair because it was "too frizzy". It was fine and looked gorgeous before that. I should take notes about self conciousness.
Ended up in a pub doing karaoke - all the ppl there were so into all the songs, noone was worried about cringe.

were 2 crowd favourites

Food highlights:
Tesco meal deal
B2B double full english I made at Jeanies
Apples! Very crisp and yummy. Bisected along their x axis for a cute star and fit-into-mouth-ability
Root vegetables were cheap so stew was good. Tried some celeriac that shit was cash, held a nice fresh watery flavour
