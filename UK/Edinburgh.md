Weird amount of statues
Lots of intellectuals - Adam Smith, David Hume, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
Also lots of op -shops, each branded by the disadvantaged group in society they are caring for. Filled with fresh quality clothes from the boomers that live there. Regret returns to haunt me about not buying any when given the opportunity.

Still has loads of cosy old timey pubs/cafes - i assume it didnt get the fuck bombed out of it in wwii

Was Guiliano's actor for a few shots - recreated some of the trainspotting opening scene in the place it was shot.
Had some big pub sessions with him and Adam.

One of the pubs was full of codgers. There were 2 blokes up the front playing live guitars, and over their heads hung a framed and embroidered quote: "yes hello this is a famous scottish independance quote"
The lead guitarist had a moaning distortion on his strings that made him deliciously croon the guitar solos - we got the sweetest rendition I have ever heard of the Game of thrones theme.
All the oldies wanted to come up and say hi to us.
This was hella sweet.
There was a lady who would have been about 40 came up to us.
The lip filler she got 10 years ago pushed her into a permanent duck face.

Bea Alexander
Bequeathed a quest by Dad to find Bea Alexander - our distant relative who may potentially have an uncle in possession of a book on Jackson family history.

Found her online to have a pilates studio in Edinburgh.
Tried to chase down her home studio, went into a medical centre and a church looking for it. Gave up, went to the address on google maps which led me to a furniture outlet - who directed me to a daoist meditation centre. Everyone tried their hardest to help me, sweet bonnie scotland.

Airport out
Full of people my age in suits working at 7:30pm. Busy boys sending busy emails making busy dollars. Made me feel self concious to pull out my laptop and start writing.

What the fuck am I doing. Both this trip and the writing of this journal is so self indulgent. Art is nothing without an audience, and the only audience is you, my dear self, sitting there in the future. I hope what I am writing helps you to relive or at

Is writing a useless venture?
What makes this worthwhile?
