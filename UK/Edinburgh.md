Weird amount of statues
Lots of intellectuals - Adam Smith, David Hume, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
Also lots of op -shops, each branded by the disadvantaged group in society they are caring for. Filled with fresh quality clothes from the boomers that live there.

Still has loads of cosy old timey pubs/cafes - i assume it didnt get the fuck bombed out of it in wwii

Was Guiliano's actor for a few shots - recreated some of the trainspotting opening scene in the place it was shot.
Had some big pub sessions with him and Adam.

Bea Alexander
Bequeathed a quest by Dad to find Bea Alexander - our distant relative who may potentially have an uncle in possession of a book on Jackson family history.

Found her online to have a pilates studio in Edinburgh.
Tried to chase down her home studio, went into a medical centre and a church looking for it. Gave up, went to the address on google maps which led me to a furniture outlet - who directed me to a daoist meditation centre. Everyone tried their hardest to help me, sweet bonnie scotland.

Airport out
Full of people in suits working at 7:30pm. Busy boys sending busy emails making busy dollars. Made me feel self concious to pull out my laptop and start writing.

Is writing a useless venture?
What makes this worthwhile?
