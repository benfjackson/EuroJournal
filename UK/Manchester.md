did the one thing dad said not to do: get caught with illegal drugs
Luckily I lied to them and got to keep my weed vape
And the small amount of MD I had in my system

The most used drug here is steroids
Modern cathedral -> decorated with lithium and plastic instead of gold
Football chants are referenced

Church without church

Lights
The mainstage lights have "dance moves" that they do

Had tea with a cute stranger I saw reading a book in a cafe.
"Don't ever let anyone tell you how to make your tea."
Incredible wisdom. Just because it has been done a particular way for hundreds of years, doesn't mean its the way I like to drink it.

Very impressed with the the fashion here.
Was the first industrial city ever

Tuesday night out
student night at the local club dungeon
fairies and goblins theme - there was a 4 queen show
played good music - snuck a dubstep track in
I WAS the beauty standard "you're fit!" girlies were loving the Jesus bit had like 8 girls drooling over the course of the night.

manchester art gallery & portico library
Saw the same golden syrup that Jeanie had in their kitchen. This time it was behind a glass case. It had a disclaimer that the contents was made by slaves.

Had my first appreciation of abstract art in an exhibition of textile art.
They were repeatable patters, meant for large scale production by machine. The prints were all intentionally abstract said the lady who made them - abstract representations of something at most.
I think what made me like it compared to a
Conventional abstract piece of art on a canvas displayed on the wall
The art was not the feature itself, it was a decoration of something else.
It was not aesthetics for the sake of it, intended to be stared at for the sake of itself, it was the decoration of something else.
Like the sun - looking at it directly is too much, it must be appreciated when reflected off other things.

foo'ball
Joined a "footy addicts" organised game. Got relegated to the winning team.
Had some nice touches and a shot on goal which dinged off the post from the keepers gloves.
Sent in a nice cross, which got the reactions:
"that was a good ball tho" the height of praise in british slang
"I thought you said you'd never played before"
Won 9-1

Alan Turing Memorial adjacent to the clubbing area - gayville.
Saw him on my way home multiple times.
Wonder if he hopped on the piss around there back in his day.

Big tall red orange brick - new gothic. Gorgeously industrial.

Food highlights:
Lots of chips everywhere - this was reflected in the statures of the population (ppl were thiccer here) gasp emoji naughty emoji.
Burger ingredients were cheap so I had some yummy bongas
