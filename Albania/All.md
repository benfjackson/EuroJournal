Beaches

Island hopping
Diving off the jetty - underneath an electric blue with a vibrant orange rust
A large amount of these images remain visually captured only with the minds eye - I could not take my phone swimming.

Canyon swimming, rock climbing and jumping on the edible
Dans hunger for a party hostel led us to an Australian run hostel.
Kracker, local legend, the reason Dan was able to convice us to stay another night, left immediately after (not really) saying hello. Instead we were treated to a host of characters

Gorgeous mediterranean coastline
Orange mountains into clear blue waters

Driving
We rented a car. (suboptimal pricing but it was a fun activity)
At the start we picked Raph, our most timid, but also our insurance holder to do the driving. My god it was stressful in Tirana, first coz Raph was so cautiously not driving like a local, then Dan so uncautiously did.
Driving through the mountains was very nice, and on the highways it was fun to see the recklessness with which the shining audis would scream past at 200+km an hour.
I was at the helm to take the car back into Tirana, by this time so desensitised to the Albanian road rules that I too, was able to drive like a local. Right of way is determined by who has the larger cock.

Dan and I were treated to live music running late in Skhoder. Modern Albanian music ran effects like reverb over traditional instruments. They played songs that melted into eachother to create a single enormous string of incredible violin, guitar, keyboard and other solos.
The old grump in our room complained the following day but hostely was the cultural highlight of Shkoder. Planning for things means things outside the plan become nuisances rather than something interesting to be discovered.

Food highlights
Stuffed peppers and eggplants were cash.
Salads similar to shopska were mwah - well oiled
We had yummy preserved fruits, in particular a large jar of apricots preserved with a hint of vanilla.

Finally! local, Cheap olive oil.

Arugla ice cream - DELICIOUS! paired with white chocolate and other sweet goodies, the trace amounts of rocket provided a vibrant green and a smokey flavour to the ice cream
