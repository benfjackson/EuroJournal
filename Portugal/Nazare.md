Had lots of wine on the beach with Wilker. No bottle opener so we ended up pushing the cork in and holding it down with my sunglasses while drinking it.

The place with the largest waves in the world.
When we were there it was practically flat.

Nazare had such a cute old town, long winding streets where tourists would often stop to take a photo of the curling lane.
Gorgeous white houses with a red tiled roof.
Lots of tiled depictions of Santa Maria.

Went surfing eek

Food highlights

Small mussel/molluscy things & an octopus salad. The octopus had a spongey texture and was delicious, but it was breakfast so it was intense.

Sun dried fish bought from an old lady who sat with her racks all day peddling fish.
