Had lots of wine on the beach with Wilker. No bottle opener so we ended up pushing the cork in and holding it down with my sunglasses while drinking it.

The place with the largest waves in the world.
When we were there it was practically flat.

Nazare had such a cute old town, long winding streets where tourists would often stop to take a photo of the curling lane.
People entrapped in its beauty would be forced to stop and take a photo with their phone.
Gorgeous white houses with a red tiled roof.
Lots of tiled depictions of Santa Maria.

Went surfing eek

I was interviewed by a drama teacher from New York (in the characters sheet as the american lady, as if she was to be the only american lady I would meet), who wanted to know about my biggest failures in life.
She was collecting material to create a lesson that would build resilience in her students, for she claimed that young people don't have the resilience they should.
To dismiss this as the ramblings of a boomer would be naive, as the incredibly entertaining wonders of smartphones and videogames certainly lure me into prematurely giving up on projects I may have completed in a previous lifetime.
With a wealth of failures to draw upon, I chose to comment upon the failings of Abby.
To disprove the boomer and show off my young resilience, the focal point of my monologue was about how I reimagined my unemployment as liberation, gaining the freedom to adventure and travel.
Unbeknownst to her and myself at the time, this choice provides excellent opportunity for self-psychoanalysis.
I think it shows my bitterness at the demise of Abby - she was my child too.
In my own kind, passive and non-blaming way, I blamed Charlies leadership for Abbys decline. While I think there is truth in this, I think at this point I was holding on to bitterness I was unwilling to acknowledge.
It is also interesting I picked to discuss this over my breakup with Liv.
Despite the mental self flagilation over the minutest transgressions that dominated my internal monologue for months, I was unwilling to talk about it in this public space.
It reminds me of how when asked about our Indonesia trip, I would divert attention away from the fact I was going with my girlfriend, rebranding it to a cultural trip by mentioning how excited I was to speak Indonesian again.

Food highlights

Small mussel/molluscy things & an octopus salad. The octopus had a spongey texture and was delicious, but it was breakfast so it was intense.

Sun dried fish bought from an old lady who sat with her racks all day peddling fish.
