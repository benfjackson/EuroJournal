Stayed with Wilker and his uncle out in the burbs
The 3 most useful words were: Obrigado - thanks, Pastel de nata - portugese tart, and Benfica - the football team that Wilkers uncles supported.
They would be in the miuddle of a conversation about things I couldnt understand, but then I'd hear the word Benfica - again.
I had to pledge my allegiance to Benfica multiple times.

Sintra -
The Portugese royal family's summer holiday home. Had beautiful vivid ochre colours on the outside. Lovely arabic geometric patterning everywhere.

Food Highlights

Pastel de Nata
delicious portugese tarts. Crispy/flaky pastry around cinnamony custard. I think i would have had about 20 or so.

Bifana
Some soaked meat in a bun. Plain but good with chilli sauce and mustard.

The small orange fruit (nespera) that were growing everywhere - a little sour and sweet with a few massive seeds in the middle.
