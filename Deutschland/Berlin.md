Anarchist vibe

Sysiphus I
Went with my X. (hehe)
Incredible people watching. So many people from different cultures. Sitting in the smokers area I could hear languages spanning the continents.
Everyone was dressed in their party attire from home.
I didnt see any security guards around, it seemed like noone really needed them - they were strict on the door about not letting in bad vibes.
The place reminded me of the Night Circus. I was wandering in wonder at all the intricate details that painted magic onto the place. Walls of art, hanging antiques, a telephone that called its twin across the yard, a giant mirror ball spotlighted in deep golds, and filled with characters in vibrant costumes. I saw people with hula hoops, people pushing around tiny unicorns on wheels, someone getting walked on their leash.

On the third night I was too hungover to go out. I put on my pyjamas to go to bed. Fortunately, my pyjamas comprised of bright red socks, batik pants and my spooky man from arnhem land. A perfect outfit for Sisyphos. Equipped with the remaining mushroom brownie from Amsterdam, I braved the club in my battle armour and had a great time.
On the way home it was Jess and I, smelling flowers and listening to bees. We had a moment of connection with nature through the a patch of lavender in the median strip of a dismally Berlin grey road.
And then she vaguely hit on me by mentioning she wanted to read some smut when she got home, showing me her hinge date, saying she wanted to fuck, touching my shoulder etc.

Went hard to emphasises the banaltiy of evil
Silly little hat photos
Juxtaposed the nazi's euphemistic language with the more real terms such as mass murder.

Food Highlights
Cigarettes count as a meal right?
My appetite was fucked from all the hard drugs so I got to save money not getting too much food.
Had an awesome doner and a great felafel tho
A nice vegan burger too.
Made some hotdogs with some wurst and honey mustard
