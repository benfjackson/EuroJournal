I picked the cheapest hostel I could find, for $33 a night I had round the clock access to crack right outside my door.
Thankfully, it was right across the road from the main train station, which was a blessing because I had woken up at 5 that morning to hike an hour with my pack to make it to the bus station. Goddam Dutch with their workers rights and not running public transport at 5am on a Sunday.
The hike was nice, I got to see the packs of kids outside the clubs, still chewing their gum, toting their leather and playing with their sunglasses.

I heard gunshots a few times when I went for a walk.

Maybe because I am in a rough hood, but there is a very strong law enforcement presence here. It blends in well with the fascist architecture. Apparently the socialists are in power here.
Public transport has been free - they charge 1.80 for it but there are no barriers even in central station.

Food highlights
Got a schnitzel in a cozy little homely place. It was a brown wooden bar with the kitchen of a home in the other room.
The guy who lived the place had a hunched back and a large leather wallet filled with notes of all colour and origin.
He took my order then walked out back, beat some egg, breaded my schnitty then fried it up with the potatoes. It reminded me of the food Bridget and I make, fried stuff with plenty of olive oil, a little crisp and a little softness.
The restaurant felt like it was his home, he lived in and cared for it.
I could see the receipts for the groceries tucked next to me under the counter.
Nothing felt commercial, you were in his home and he was cooking for you.
Pork, eggs, 1.25L bottles of coca cola.
Caring for the place and flipping pork fillets for 10 euro a pop, it seemed like honest living. I wonder if he is content, I hope he is.

Soy drink thing - the supermarkets were offering little drinkable tubs of soy yoghurt mixed with bourbon and vanilla. It was kind of like a lassie back home.
