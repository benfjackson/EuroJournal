20 hours in Chengdu
Warmups

It transformed the layover into a day out exploring Central China. I've never been big on escape rooms but the airport was a good one.
The first stage was to make it through border control - a booked hostel was needed, which required wifi. While google and all of the rest of the West's propaganda websites were blocked, Hostel world was thankfully working.

The other piece of forbidden western technology was my credit card. The card machines and ATM blocked my best attempts to get an airport feed, but after some back-calculation I figured out how many of my Euros to cash in to the airports horrific money changing rate. A quick nutritious and filling breakfast of honey soy chippies and I was ready to go exploring.

Between the locals' lack of English and the internet's lack of google, I had no tips about where to go: it was me and my wits vs the city, 80s style. I found a clue about where to go in the hostel description - the name of a street with plenty of food and some markets, looked it up on the metro board and got a ticket there. 3 train changes later I made it to the city!

Wandering around, there were an outrageous number of bubble tea shops that had delivery drivers running with the intensity of athletes to carry bags of tea to their customers. Naturally, I ended up having multiple bubble teas.
I seemed to be in the middle of their shopping district - more luxury brands than I could name had stores with shoppers strutting between them in micro jackets and thick black sunglasses. Right next to the shops there was a complex of Buddhist temples with beautiful golden Buddahs adorned in plenty of lucky red.
The two sections met under a traditional wooden roof with corners that flick up. The beautiful traditional building was now home to a Louis Vuitton store.

While sipping my third bubble tea of the day, I ran into a Spanish guy who had been suffering through the pain the morning with me. We wandered down to a nearby river. It ended up having

- markets
- street food

Large groups of seniors were just chilling down by the river playing chinese chess. I was invited for a game but the large crowd watching a single game looked so intimidating.
We were served refillable tea by the river.
They served us brown mince in a bowl that looked like a dog food bowl.
