- went to a mansion owned by the Medici family. They were a banking family that were the most powerful in Europe in the 14th century. Their rise to power was enabled because the head of the family had a godfather-like position of power - all the families in their faction were connected through him. He facilitated all the business dealings between all the families.
  They bought this mansion which was slowly filled with treasures as they and other kings and Emperors stayed there.
  They had an absolutely gorgeous set of cups and gravy boats. Precious stones carved into elegant shapes and adorned with gold. Crazy that people actually ate out of them.
  Lots of cool statues, some violent ones which were really intense to see in the 3D form. I saw a couple of statues that were set up to look at eachother.
  Absolutely incredible collection of paintings - gallery of modern art had a bunch of french battle scenes.
  There was an older collection with the Roman pagan gods - I could pick most of them, even a few niche ones ;P
  Napoleons bathroom wass filled of statues of naked girls. I wonder if they were there for him to chuck a wank.

- Saw a man singing opera in a square, he was v good as far as I could tell

- R people even thinking about the significance of the places they visit?
  Is it just commodotised travel. You go places people say are famous and important, you take pictures of them.
  It's crazy to think of the parties they held in the mansion.

- Food highlights - red wine, pecorino, guancale pasta. Mamma mia it was my favourite so far. Street food hamburger ancestor: The same flavour of ham grandma Mary used in her soups. It was stewed, then put on a bun with some italiany preserves. He dipped the edge of the bun into the stew for some extra moisture/flavour
