- Went out and yarned to some locals. They were all cool and hot and very friendly.
  They took me to some club that was like Disco but in Italian with the worst DJs ive ever seen (didnt fuck up the mix but none of it was danceable - it was like a cryptic not quite latin beat) They apologized coz they said they normally go to better techno clubs.

- All the Italians were hot and well dressed. Painted fingernails were fairly normal on the fellas here.

- Given that I loved italian fashion so much, I lurked around flea markets a lot, hunting for a nice jacket. While I found some excellent specimens, my concerns about money kept me from buying them. I bought a collection of plain black socks for a euro. The finest Italian cottons.

- Farmers market. Sat by a stall of some blokes making a traditional italian pastry with proscutto and a flat crispbread kinda thing.
  The guy was dressed in all denim and looked Roman.
  I loved the pride they took in the eating experience. The guy would talk to everyone who came to the stall. When a vegetarian arrived, he went over to the cheese stall and got some cheese. For the rest of the afternoon they came back and forth to eachothers stalls giving eachother gifts and talking in Italian. No idea what they were saying but I know it was cheeky.

- Again they had some gorgeous churches. Bit ridiculous at this point how many insane ones there are.

- "Bologna is the Berlin of Italy" - Graffiti

- They had some cool eating markets with awesome cheese and meat shops. An outrageous number of parmagiano wheels lining the walls.

Food highlights:

- finding out Im pretty much as good as the Italians at making pasta. Not the better chefs, but the average ones. What matters most is the ingredients used.

- Had a delicious Pistacio and dark choccy gelato. Ate it in the park with a cute German law student. Easily the best date I've been on in ages, I just talked to her in the line and she was nice so we went.
