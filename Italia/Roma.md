Major points

- very touristy, so many people here thank god I didnt come in peak season (is it just spring break?) (I got overstimulated so easily)
  Tourists were from everywhere. Lots of European people, lots of languages I couldnt understand. 0 Australians.

- Churches everywhere, All of them were crazily good. otw to see one, I ran into 3 of the craziest churches Id ever seen. Some of them were hidden inside ruins/in unassuming

- The priest thought I was praying but I was just in silent meditative contemplation. Which is praying.

- So much gold in all the churches (donated by the spanish post south america conquest)

- Organ worth 2m asking for donations coz they can't afford repairs

- Saw two italian women in these tiny cars almost get in a bingle. Both of them immediately wound down their windows to deliver the other an animated and emphatic spray accompanied by many hand gestures.

- The waiters were all so serious, they loved caring for their restaurants. There was no hurry - keeping the restaurant in order was most important. I was allowed to chill at my table while the waiter would keep the restaurant - clearing tables etc instead of bringing my bill.
  Highlights of what I ate:
  4 seasons pizza with anchovies, salami, artichoke
  Roman meatballs
  Pizza with tomato, mozz and basil
  Paninis

- Architecture was lovely, there was a common lovely textured rustic ochre paint.

- Lots of secret police everywhere - modern regime in amongst all the ancient ones. Their sirens were constantly going off as they raced around town. Italians are so dramatic.

- So many different eras of history coexisting. Everyone loved to conquer Roma. Link sacks of Rome
  Woe to the vanquished

- Cant tell if Italians are arguing or friendly

- SPQR on the aqueduct drinking fountains
