Referred to his wife as his bicycle.

American Lady
Older lady who kept wanting to hang out.
Wanted to interview me for her teaching project. She wants to teach young people resilience because they dont know how to deal with failure.

## Alicante

Thomas and Bella, both from LA
Said they both missed their car time, that public transport was annoying.
Bella told me to roll up my sleeves on the beach so I don't get a "farmers tan" - unnattractive lower class traits. Her father developed property for the homeless/disadvantaged. She went to Harvard on a water polo scholarship. She was really good at water polo because her father pushed her very hard - she described borderline abusive behaviour from her dad when she didn't perform well. Still said that family is the most important thing, you have to love them unconditionally. Yes but they should make it easy for you.

### True Real Mancunians

Everyone was very friendly and loved interacting with me/eachother. I saw the tram driver stop the tram and lean out his window to give visibly lost people some directions.
A guy stopped me in the street to tell me he loved my hair
