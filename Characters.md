# Portugal

Wilkers uncle
Unloaded the family trauma onto Wilker right in front of me. Wilker was translating to me (as he was hearing for the first time) the war crimes his family witnessed (maybe committed?) and their fleeing to Portugal from Angola.
Referred to his wife as his bicycle.

American Lady
Older lady who kept wanting to hang out.
Although she was not /that/ old, the cigarettes and sun had taken their toll and left her saggy and crispy at the same time. She wore her bikini and makeup like she was clinging onto her youth.
Wanted to interview me for her teaching project. She wants to teach young people resilience because they dont know how to deal with failure.
I was experiencing my first bout of sadness at leaving a friend (Wilker), and just wanted to be on my own. Despite her multiple invitations to come and hang with her on the beach, I went on my own. I still ended up seeing her down at the beach, but pretended to not and walked off.

Thomas and Bella, both from LA
Said they both missed their car time, that public transport was annoying.
Bella told me to roll up my sleeves on the beach so I don't get a "farmers tan" - unnattractive lower class traits. Her father developed property for the homeless/disadvantaged. She went to Harvard on a water polo scholarship. She was really good at water polo because her father pushed her very hard - she described borderline abusive behaviour from her dad when she didn't perform well. Still said that family is the most important thing, you have to love them unconditionally. Yes but they should make it easy for you.

# Barcelona

I sat with an older Spanish man to have a baguette.
He was there to pump wine, read the paper and have a feed.
We shared what small words we could. He said visit the Sagrada familia in the morning. Shouted me an espresso at the end of my lunch.

## London

### True Real Mancunians

Everyone was very friendly and loved interacting with me/eachother. I saw the tram driver stop the tram and lean out his window to give visibly lost people some directions.
A guy stopped me in the street to tell me he loved my hair
Mancunians were invariably proud of their working class roots.

Liam

## Edinburgh

Guliano
Director

Adam

Grace
Not her real name, she just gave the vibes of one.

The Adelaide Man
Speaking to him was a fever dream. Aussie battler type. Full of stories that never felt super original. Tough to get a word in. Was playing strong defence on the cute goth girl (I saw him ask for and get a hug when he left), who came to speak to me only after he left.

# Amsterdam

# Haarlem

Dani the storyteller
Wild brown hair, eyes that widened to express any and every microemotion that passed through her words. She spoke with such a passion, and taught me about telling stories and told me one of hers. The story featured another story told to her by a patron of a bar she used to work at. It was about a man who saved all his pennies and died before spending any of them on anything meaningful, with the moral to not wait for life to happen, to reach out and seize it. Fuggit we ball.
She said the way to pull people into stories is to give them a few details about the setting and characters first. Describe the person & place in a way that tells u who they are.

# Hamburg

6 Australians. Reminder that Im doing pretty well on my travels experiencing culture etc.
They were just here to drink beer in different places and make loud & unoriginal shitty racist jokes.
He rattled off a long list of places he'd been. Although I barely saw him leave the hostel, I'm sure he'll add Hamburg to the list.

The Boring American
This man was straight out of every hinge nightmare meme.
He told me in incredibly meticulous detail about whatever he was talking about - bouldering, concerts, fighter jet engines, engineering procedures.
He was seemingly unphased when I'd change the topic of conversation mid-monologue.
Was very into bouldering
he showed me a 5 minute video of a concert and pulled it back up for me after id watched 30secs then scrolled away.
Threw my best at him but finally I cracked him with a dick joke.

# Berlin

Kitkat Jesus
Self proclaimed - you cannot be a self proclaimed Jesus.
He wore a little crown to emphasise this.
Was super proud of how he ~owned~ kitkat.
I saw him the following week going around vaguely begging/getting rejected.

The Mysterious Anarchist.
Seen sunday morning 8am next to the river reaching into bins, collecting the glass bottles to hurl aggressively overhand style into the pavement, spraying shards into the river. After he finished with his first bin, he kept crawling up the river hunting for more bins.

Alyna
Blind girl who loved going clubbing.
"What's your lore?"

Kobe
Tech bro crypto CEO LARPing as a gay guy.
Works 7 days a week. I see him post his ice baths on insta.
Was staying above the Berlin wall but showed no appreciation for it.
Bragged about being good at manipulation. - Got like 20 euro drinks off me and lots of drugs off Duane.
He dodged my kiss but I fucked him in chess.
He gave up and made the earliest concede I've seen.
I made him keep playing, no giving up like a bitch.
He referred to the second half as "only playing for fun" as if that wasnt what we were already doing.
Ordered us breakfast - himself the smoked salmon platter and me the cheese for 16 euro apiece.
An atrociously meagre feed turned up - I left before finishing mine.

George
Bold, muscular
Stays at Sandino for months on end.
Incredible at making friends, he would strike up conversations out of nothing. Ended up sharing a bottle of wine on the spot with a guy he talked to off the train.

# Serbia

## Kremna

I was riding my bike down a lane that wound down behind the holiday park when I stopped to see a little
There was an old man lying in it, peering out at me.
He was old and grizzled, browned from days of lying in various positions.
I saw him watching, from various positions around the complex.
He was always hard to spot, as he mostly occupied nooks and shaded corners as he sat to observe
What he was snooping on I'm not sure, but it was directly next to where the kids were playing.

# Tapa Forest

Dajana
Learnt my name from my passport, so for a week I was Benjamin.

Tempted me so hard with the run away from society to live simply in the woods lifestyle.

Seriously and gravely told us how the bosniak genocide was self defence.
We went mushroom hunting together.
Wanted to adopt me - negative age gaps way of saying how hubby material I am.
"Don't feed the stray dog."

Ed & Sean
Instantly clocked Sean, but only Ed when I saw him with Sean.
Useless finance types who weren't so bright - incredulous I knew what dogma meant.
Weeks after we left Serbia, I saw them post on insta stories about their adventures in Mitrovac in present tense.
Life and travel was a commodity to be reheated in the microwave of instagram and served up to in performance for the audience of instagram.

The Porridge World Champion
Porridge theory was deeply discussed amongst the 5 English who were here for the night.
Sean messaged his friend who enjoyed porridge, who then promptly put up a minute long story weeping about how much porridge meant to her.
English people. You can't make that shit up.

# Albania

Another Boring American
Accused us of not being good to talk to. His contributions to the conversation were: "What is ur favourite colour?"
"What is ur perfect day?"

# Montenegro

\_, the Italian writer who preferred cigarettes to caffiene
She wore a bar between her eyes and kept her hair short.
Difficult to make eye contact with as she usually kept her gaze to herself, but had a soul wrenching depth of brown upon finally ensnaring your.
And had an inky crescent moon guarding her heart.
