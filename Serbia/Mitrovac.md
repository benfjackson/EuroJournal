Next to a flowing river of iron and diesel

I have been reading with a religious fervour my grandparents would reserve for the bible. The book is named Speak, Memory.

The mystic forest. Truly, it is its namesake.

# Mycological Adventures

# Picking and grilling with Dijana

Behind the house there was a line of tall trees, and creeping past the silent guardians would lead you to a forest enchanted by dappled sunlight, mossy reading perches and a rainbow assortment of mushrooms.

My arrival was closely followed by a glorious thunderstorm that coaxed the buried mycelium to sprout its fingers into the sky in the hope it will not be dismembered by those above that hunger. Unfortunately for them, our grill was ravenous.

Now, the only people that are killed by poisonous mushrooms are stupid tourists who think life is a game and don't understand the very real dangers of eating the strange growths of the forest.
Fortunately I am not one of them, for I am invincible.

The siren of the forest sung to us of a grill filled with delicious mushrooms.

So, with the song of the siren ringing in our ears, we ventured into the forest armed with two empty buckets and a brazen belief in our invincibility.

We wandered amongst the trees, eyes gleefully searching for treasures buried amongst the leaves.
Three main species presented themselves to us.
First some golden brown medallions that wept milky tears as they were carried off for slaughter.
Second, and most rarely, a pure white specimen that enjoyed its solitude, gleaming on its lonesome occaisonally around the forest.
Finally we a slimy fellow with a green and purple speckled top that made it appear the least edible of the three, despite Dijana (the Serbian keeper of the hostel, a keen chef who dreamed of retiring to the country with a cow and her knitting needles) assuring me was the safest and most delicious of our collection.

Dijana and I went about roaming the forest, shouts of joy announcing
another thrilling find.
How exhilirating! Spying some prey hiding in the brush, prancing over, bending over for inspection then reaching in to pluck from the dirt the gorgeous trophy by its thick white stem. Truly the thrill of a hunt.

When our buckets were full, we took our haul to the neighbour, an older Serbski browned and wisened by his years on the mountain.
The cigarette drooped from his mouth as he delivered a lesson in mycology unintelligible to I.
He approved our greenish slimes, then encouraged us to lick the white ones - he grinned as we gagged at the acrid taste.
Our brown finds he wasnt sure of and encouraged us to throw out at risk of death.

The naivety of youth and overconfidence in the internet led us to ask our friend Google about the identity of our mysterious mushrooms. Reverse image search led us to the wikipedia entry for (the edible) Lactifluus Volemus, which overconfident stupidity assured us was certainly the true name of the final mushroom.

So, we grilled them all.
Deliciously salty, charred and smokey, we feasted upon their delicious flesh under the golden sun of the meadow.

Two days later another storm graced us with another two bucketfulls of frolicking in the forest. This time the adventure's bounty was stewed into a deliciously rich tomatoey goulash, which at the time I write this has been in my stomach less than the 6 hours a mistakenly picked poisonous specimen will take to kill me.
So, let these be my final words: I have lived most deliciously.

I lay in the green glade. a sliver of ferns sliced from the forest
, incision into the forest

Dappled light floated in and out of
I was the butterfly, flitting across
Sunflowers
