The wooing of Repunzel.
The guy caring for the hostel was Art, a lovely Russian guy who had a very matter of fact sense of humor. He had a big crush on the girl from the northern beaches who was as tall as I with long golden hair and a bland personality. I would catch him stealing long glances at her, and she may have too.
Unfortunately for him, he wasnt a massive looker, and I don't think she got his Russianisms.
One night he prepared for us a delicious dinner. On his grill he cooked us the best cevapi I had, and some smoked chicken. It was once of those meals that used its deliciousness to lure me well past the point of too-fullness.

He had given her a private room (the sly dog) on the first floor with a balcony. When everything was cooked, he went to woo her from the garden.
"Anna! The cevapi is cooked, dinner is served for you!"
I did not hear her response, but unfortunately Repunzel did not let down her hair.
