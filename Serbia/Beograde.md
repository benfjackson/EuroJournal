Crippled in Beograde.

I didn't do a lot here, as my knees still ached when I walked. Attempting 0km days only go well when it is nice to stay in the hostel. I had a pod, but the common area was cramped, had phone zombies and low quality gore-horror movies on the tv.

I found a nice (ish (close)) smoking cafe to write at, but a sweet Korean lady wanted to practice her English. Never one to say no, she ended up declaring me the nciest person she had met on her trip. She taught me the korean writing system, which is logical, makes sense, and is pretty.

I also went to a military museum and saw various tanks, missiles and other killing technologies.
I saw the old defence ministry, still in its bombed out state. "The bombings" were referred to as a world ending event by the Serbian lads I would later hang out with in Ada Bojana.
The graffiti changed political messaging from Anarchist signs to various cyrillic messages and an english "Fuck NATO"
