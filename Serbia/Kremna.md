Kremna was a beautiful little village.
It could be circumnavigated in 10 minutes on a bike and fit perfectly into the frame of a single photograph taken from the hill.
It had a soccer field, two stores and a gang of kids.
They ambushed me at the holiday park I was staying in - they were lurking around up to nothing which seemed to be their favourite and the only thing to do.
With incredibly sweet and energetic personalities, they told me about how despicable Albanians are and casually alluded to knowing people who beat up gays.
Enamoured with the coolest Australian they had ever seen, they took me on a quest to fill the bike tires. We toured the cosy little village, interrogating anyone caught in their front yard in search for a pump. Everyone had a connection to the kids - some were in the family, others had divorced, and the rest had just dated in high school.

Everyone in Serbia was very kind to me.
Utopian peace achieved through brutal ethnic cleansing.
