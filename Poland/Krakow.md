Party Hostel
Felt like fresher week. So many 18y/os
Beer was cheap so smacked several of them with the other (slightly) older ppl in the corner.

# Love and Death Camps

I called Tyson the day afterwards to have a sook about my lack of holiday romance. The universe was listening too, because not an hour later, I met Emma.
Existentialist, chain smoker, master of the French pout.

A theme of my trip has been dealing with feelings of regret. Lunches I should have bought, people I should have gone home with, museums I should have visited, drugs I should have hidden better - the missed opportunities holding me back from adventuring perfectly have mercilessly haunted my subconcious.
I am aware that nothing can be perfect.
I am aware that I should focus on and be thankful for the incredible experiences I have been able to enjoy.

Regardless, my internal monologue has constant discussions with a critic who understands my every shortcoming, my every mistake, and loves to point out to me how I could have done better.
Life is a game of the minutest margins, and the wings of the butterfly decide between misery and ecstasy.
A brief episode of thoughtlessness is all it takes to make an irreversibly poor decision that will lead you down the path towards the hooded figure with sharp instruments of mental torture.
My torture would occur as I performed the mundanities of life, unremarkable banalities that were taking the place of what should have been my victorious prizes.
I would sit and realise, in the emptiness, the wonders of what could have been.
My vivid imagination would treat me to illustrious visions of the joy that had been tantalizingly at my fingertips then cast aside by some flash of my own stupidity.

My demons of regret were to come face-to-face with Edith Piaf in an incredible episode of my adventures set in Krakow, Poland.
Before we journey to the south of Poland however, we must detour to Berlin.
In Berlin I went on a six day bender, sampling the wide variety of elixirs, magic powders, tiny runestones and herbal remedies that the magical city and its inhabitants had to offer.
Despite this excitement, the most intense comedown I suffered from the ever potent and intoxicating oxytocin.
The primal brain treats the abandonment of a group of friends as seriously as death itself - for our ancestors the former would almost certainly lead to the latter. Upon leaving my fiesta friends (and someone I had a flicker of a romance with), I was approached by regret's executioner.

I had run from Berlin to Prague, a notoriously beautiful city

She got up to leave, announcing the final moments before opportunity's extended hand would release me to fall once again into regret's abyss.
Life itself hung poised, awaiting my action that would push its delicate balance act either into the ravine of despair or the heavenly clouds of joys ascension.

The butterfly's wings pushed me forwards, forwards to say hello, forwards to ask if she was alone too, forwards to ask if she would like to escape together into the company of anothers presence.
I wonder how many soulmates of mine have balanced upon this knife only to fall into the abyss of lost never-knowing.

Emma was her name. She was French, an existentialist and a chainsmoker (a triplet tautology). We looked alike - cautiously pretty in wavily curled brown hair worn with bangs and a triangle that rests just above the shoulders. We thought alike - educated in the logics of STEM and lamenting the lack of art's romantic touch in our schooling. We traveled alike - sitting, observing and making interesting commentary about the way people are.

Although English was her second language, she was still able to understand me better than anyone else I had met on my trip.
Stripped of the wordplay and extended vocabulary I am partial to, we distilled the infinite complexities youth's angst and the life's absurdity into a simple mutually understandable set of words. Finally, I felt I had met someone who understood and saw the world as I did.

All we want is to see recognition of ourselves in another, to see that there are others who think like us, who feel like us - to be not so horrifically alone in this absurd world.

We each went to Auschwitz in seperate languages.

We spent five nights together. By the third we were making out ferociously in public, much to our immediate pleasure and restrospective embarrassment.
Despite her obvious extreme arousal evidenced by her enjoyment of heavy petting, she declined a dirty fuck in the toilet.
She also was partial to biting me with excessive force, two pieces of evidence hinting at the later revealed fact that she had never had sex before.
The fourth night was a magical picnic at a lake, where this changed.
The "very good" of her response to me checking how she felt transformed into a paragraph of French poetry upon encouragement to use her own tongue.
My responding "oui" held in it a longing, a despair at not fully being able to know the wonders that float around her mind. I don't know what she said and I'm not sure I ever will, her feelings shall forever remain mysterious and very French.

On our final night together we went to Alchemia, a bar where we knew the bartender Iwo.

It was an incredibly cosy bar with a warren of rooms lit by soft candlelight.
On Saturday its rustic wooden tables had been packed out with people playing cards and drinking tea infused vodka, however our luxuriously unemployed Monday night visit meant that it was empty.

We found a nice quiet corner in the back room to relieve our mouths of their duties discussing stupid intellectual matters. The rising tension escalated to me getting up with half an idea of asking Iwo for the key - no need, there was a latch lock on the door.
Fortune herself pressed the door shut for us, and we were left alone with the soft candlelight and a cast of antique chairs and tables.

I wish I had spent every waking minute with her.
Each moment I actively chose to remain on my own and not be with her has been a twist of Regret's knife.

---

The counterinsurgency to my feelings of regret was fittingly led by none other than Edith Piaf herself.
As Emma and I sat in the bar, Iwo promised us a classic from each of our countries. I didn't need a fucking crystal ball to know that he was going to play Land Down Under, but his pick of a 2010s French club hit subverted our mutual prediction of the classic, the timeless, the profoud /Non, je ne Regrette Rien/. Regardless, Edith sung me her existentially sonorous lullaby for the next week straight, battling the tormenter who was enjoying pointing out how precious time together is and how much of it I chose to spend in solitude.

Food highlights
Zapekanke
They were like a baguette with mushroom, cheese and various toppings on them

Pierogi were ok, I dont think I got super good ones. The day I was leaving I saw some for sale to be cooked in the kitchen, but I had no kitchen access ;\_;
