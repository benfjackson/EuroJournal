Party Hostel
Felt like fresher week. So many 18y/os
Beer was cheap so smacked several of them with the other (slightly) older ppl in the corner.

I called Tyson the day afterwards to have a sook about my lack of holiday romance. The universe was listening too, because not an hour later, I met

Emma.
Existentialist, chain smoker, French.

Picnic

Non, je ne regrette rien.

Food highlights
Zapekanke
They were like a baguette with mushroom, cheese and various toppings on them

Pierogi were ok, I dont think I got super good ones. The day I was leaving I saw some for sale to be cooked in the kitchen, but I had no kitchen access ;\_;
