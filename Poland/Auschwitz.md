Train there in air conditioned comfort

On the shuttle bus between the camps, the lady who ran the tours coolly and relaxedly told us about "interesting" books about the horrific true stories of the camp.
She technically worked at the camp.
Working somewhere will desensitize you to anything.

There was a large collection of things taken from the victims upon arrival. They were shipped back to Berlin and redistributed to Germans.
Parallels to thrift shopping for second hand fast fashion brands made in sweatshops.

There were many pairs of gorgeously fashionable shoes amongst the thousands laying ownerless

In the children's barracks they'd all etched their names into the walls. Some had drawn hearts with a crushes name

They had a big wall of portraits of people staring straight down the barrel of the camera.
Name, occupation, date of deportation, date of death
Seeing this made me very emotional (also at many other points)

At the end there was harrowing art with 1000s of eyes and emaciated bodies
