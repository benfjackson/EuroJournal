FLAMENCO FLAMENCO FLAMENCO
The packed house
sternly told no photos or videos
the shapes she made with her body were twisting, but strong
She was a firm and stern dancer
She had incredible footwork, tapping super fast but always in time
Very intentional loops and turns and spins
the singer was singing like an arabic call to prayer kind of song

Going out later and dancing in the street and people doing the flamenco clapping for me (getting asked if I was a flamenco dancer)

Latin band was awesome
Real community style music - everyone had a turn, everyone was rly good
12 ppl on stage at one point
3 percussionists

Very impressed with the spanish musicality - everyone from DJs to buskers to ppl on the street were poppin off

Spanish always had a cool halo on marys head - would be a sick mardi gras headpiece

Meg was funi and chull to hang wit

Plaza del toros
Was like a sports stadium, but decorated in cool tiles rather than meat pie wrappers. Had a museum with some glorious matador costumes in them.

Historical tour:
Plaza de Espanya

Food Highlights
Yummy stew served on top of chips (I'm not lazy im just cooking traditional spanish food)
yummy tapas
i cooked paella tehe
Spanish Chorizo was cracked to cook with. So much flavour - too much if I had too large of a piece
Vinho de Naranja (wine made from oranges) was sweet and thick and yummy.
Churros saved my life when the night bus fucked me.
