Valencia water - even worse than I remembered

- Alhambra
  Didn't get to go inside bcoz tickets needed to be booked 3 months in advance (thanks mum n dad for being hyperorganised).
  It was still gorgeous from a mirador opposite.

- Spanish markets!
  Filled with gorgeous meats and disturbing flayed sheep skulls, I made a $20 sandwich with the biggest tomato I've ever seen. It was a bulbous 0.8kg monstrosity that the stall owner called "bulls balls"

- Oxtail stew on chips: turns out im not a lazy cook, leftovers on chips is actually traditional spanish cuisine!

- FLAMENCO FLAMENCO FLAMENCO
  Went and saw the same flamenco dancer 3 times.
  She was a stern dancer with incredible footwork, tapping super fast but always in time.
  A no photos or videos policy was enforced unfortunately for you all :P

Going out after the show, we were clapping and dancing in the street and locals joined in with us - some of them even asked if I was a flamenco dancer (I'm a superstar).

- Plaza del toros
  Cool to see a sports stadium decorated in artistic tiles rather than meat pie wrappers. Had a museum with some glorious matador costumes inside.

- Art Galleries
  After 6 incredible galleries and a porcelain museum, I finally saw our boy Sebby.
