Water was even more terrible than I remembered

Went to a porcelain museum hosted in an old palace.
Insane artifacts - rich ppl have always been nuts.
Had some carriages which paired surprisingly well with trap music.

It was hosting an exhibition of pencil portrait drawings. The lifelikeness was insane coz if you looked closely enough you could see the lines the works were comprised of.
Had an awesome drawing of a boy with a soccer ball and a gold medal.

There was also a fine arts museum which had a crazy collection of old stuff.
The use of gold for halos was so nice. The art was a bit more brutal and violent than the italian stylised stuff.
