Fell for a tourist trap (going to lunch with people at the hostel who i didnt like).

Went to the markets, made a 20 Euro sandwich with Meg. We got an enormous tomato that got about 6 people from multiple hostels to freak out about how large it was.

Went to museo Carmen Thyssen. There was a guy out the front of the line playing violin while we waited, setting the mood for us all.
