Barcelona reminded me of Bali in some ways.
It was a holiday destination for the local white ppl. The English, who as far as I was able to observe, behaved like cashed up bogans.
Nightclubs at night.
Not all the tourists were like this tho.
Apparently Ibiza is worse?

Gaudi got me sweatin

Guell was his mate who got rich off the slave trade and commissioned all Gaudi's pieces. The audioguide failed to mention this and was more interested in wanking Gaudi off.
Palau de Guell
Was like a willy wonka type vibe.
It felt very artificial and man made in a playful type way.
Had these turrets covered in mosaics made of shattered arabic geometric tiles. Rejection of the holy perfection of geometry, the hand of man has clearly done this.

Went to have a delicious lunch at a cute cafe.
They had old Barcelonian iconography on the walls - old photos of the place, old newspapers etc.
Sat next to an old codger who was smashing a bottle of wine with lunch. We didn't really speak eachothers languages but enjoyed eachothers company and he shouted me coffee after my feed.
It was offering a 3 course meal (which I shouldve gotten(#1 regret of the trip)) but I ordered something off their specialties menu instead. It turned out to be a baguette (which I had another in my bag for later) which was still delicious.

Sagrada familia was a church, ticketed & hidden behind a fence with guards patrolling it. Had reliefs of stations of the cross, with one of guards playing dice for Jesus clothes.
