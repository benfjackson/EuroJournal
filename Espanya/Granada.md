- Alhambra
  Tickets needed to be booked months in advance (thanks mum n dad for being hyperorganised last time), so instead went to the free palace outside was more like a colusseum and was definitely the free option.

The Alhambra was best enjoyed from the mirador opposite, where you could see the snow covered Sierra Nevada behind it.

  Had modern Catholic art from many different cultures.
  Was incredible to see fresh art crisp off the press still covering these ancient themes.

Wild herbs
Thyme and rosemary were both abundant in the mountains.
There were wild bushes - undomesticated. It was tougher than the city slicker rosemary, bred for its health and oil content. It was tough, unruly, a true country battler.

Running of the goats
While running back to catch the only bus for an hour, I was held up by choir of goats. Herded by a Spanish farmer on a motorbike, the pack of goats returned home from the mountain after a big day on the rosemary bushes.

Multiple caves filled with a chessboard of used shit tickets.

Conceived of an anti-doomscroll AI.

Afterwards had tapas, drinks, a joint and some birthday cake with Lemon and Bella from the hostel.

Food Highlights:
TAPAS!!!
Order a drink and they bring you a nice tasting platter of some food. Sit around, chat shit and eat tapas. Best one i got was 2.80euro a drink with a fat serve of tapas.

I also had a godawful number of kebabs eek.
