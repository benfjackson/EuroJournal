Travelling is an acceptable form of dead.

Strangers provide an honesty that is desensitized by familiarity. NOONE APPRECIATES ME SKREE (crabs in a bucket)

Retrospect my biggest critic.

Travelling is looking into a mosaic mirror.
Each person you meet is a shiny shard that reflects back whatever piece of being you share.
Writers, dancers, thinkers, workers, fashionistas, comedians, each life's lense affixes its gaze on a different part of you.
Together they tesselate into the great Other and provide a particulate glimpse into your own soul.
