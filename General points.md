Travelling is an acceptable form of dead.

Strangers provide an honesty that is desensitized by familiarity. NOONE APPRECIATES ME SKREE (crabs in a bucket)

Retrospect my biggest critic.

Travelling is looking into a mosaic mirror.
Each person you meet is a shiny shard that reflects back whatever piece of being you share.
Writers, dancers, thinkers, workers, fashionistas, comedians, each life's lense affixes its gaze on a different part of you.
Together they tesselate into the great Other and provide a particulate glimpse into your own soul.

Lots of people become a single thing. They find their niche and devote themselves to it. Can't comprehend why youd want to do anything else.

Some ppl dont enjoy their holidays, they just go on them.
