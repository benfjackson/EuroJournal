A theme of my trip has been dealing with feelings of regret. Lunches I should have bought, people I should have gone home with, museums I should have visited, drugs I should have hidden better - the missed opportunities holding me back from a perfect record mercilessly haunt my subconcious.
My internal monologue comprises of two voices in constant discussion: the critic who understands my every mistake and shortcoming, and my lawyer desperately trying to come up with excuses (even he knows I've failed.)
I am aware that nothing can be perfect.
I am aware that I should focus on and be thankful for the incredible experiences I have been able to enjoy.
But I always could have done better.

Life is a game of the minutest margins, and the wings of the butterfly decide between misery and ecstasy.
A brief episode of thoughtlessness is all it takes to make an irreversibly poor decision that will lead you down the path towards the hooded figure with sharp instruments of mental torture.
My torture would occur as I performed the mundanities of life, the unremarkable banalities taking the place of what should have been my victorious prizes.
I would sit and realise, in the emptiness, the wonders of what could have been.
My vivid imagination would treat me to illustrious visions of the joy that had been tantalizingly at my fingertips then cast aside by some flash of my own stupidity.

I had so much fun in Berlin on my six day bender, sampling the wide variety of elixirs, magic powders, tiny runestones and herbal remedies that the magical city and its inhabitants had to offer.
Despite this excitement, the most intense comedown I suffered from the ever potent and intoxicating oxytocin.
The primal brain treats the abandonment of a group of friends as seriously as death itself - for our ancestors the former would almost certainly lead to the latter. Upon leaving my fiesta friends (and someone I had a flicker of a romance with) I was approached by my whispering critic.

I had run from Berlin to Prague, a notoriously beautiful city
Here, I spent the two days I should have spent with Ella.

My main activity here was wallowing in regret.

I was like a regular tourist, walking around like a zombie, taking thoughtless photos of random things that zinged my photo neurons.

Once again, I learn my lesson that a place is the people.

I went to a park and was caught in the rain. I found a little alcove to shelter under. It was only me and a statue of a naked lady alone in the rain.
The universe has a cruel irony to it.

Travelling is brutal because there are fewer second chances. No slow burns allowed. If you fuck it up theyre fully gone in a different country, no texting the following day.
