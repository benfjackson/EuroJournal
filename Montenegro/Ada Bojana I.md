(backreference to a previous appearance of Watermelons) Watermelons return in this next adventure: the night on Ada Bojana.

Bar, a little Montenegronian town on the coast, looks like a shithole on google maps.
So Dan and I had only been planning to stay for 1 day, but, he ended up falling for the cute Colombian girl who was running the hostel, Veectorria
So we ended up staying for 5
(I led her in with a bait and switch so my boy could eat (he was famished) (redact this overly cokcy bullshit dan has game too))

Also working at the hostel was Alice (Aleecheh), the Italian writer who preferred cigarettes to caffiene.
She wears a bar between her eyes and keeps her hair short.
She's difficult to make eye contact with as she usually keeps her eyes to herself, but upon finally gracing you with her gaze, the soul wrenching brown of her iris is too stunningly to stare at for too long.
I know understand the allure of dark brown eyes.
An inky crescent moon guards her heart.
Most disappointingly, she has a boyfriend guarding it too.
Why did God make Italians so beautiful.

She taught us the Italian version of Mafia, featuring werewolves, a clairvoyant, and a puta, the whore who would sleep with someone to save them. Bless the Italians.

Now Bar was a quaint town, but despite having a bus station Bar, a supermarket Bar a and a primary school bar,
It Had no nightlife.
In Berlin, my Serbian friend told me of a nudist commune on a magical island called Ada Bajana (Ada Bayana), where people party all night and sleep on hammocks through the day.

It was Saturday night, and I have Naomi's birthday call tomorrow.
It's at like 10am I'll be fine.

Id recently withdrawn a large sum of money to spread the fixed cost of the atm fee (shoutout to Douggy B)
Money's tight at this end of the trip, so I gotta hold onto this 140 euro ($215aud).

Montenegros economy is under a spell where everything costs more than it seems at first glance.

Tree fiddy caught us the bus to a town nearby Ada Bojana, and I saw travellers with large bags getting stung with luggage fees (unheard of in Europe).
The bus wound its way through the gorgeous Montenegroian mountains, treating us to a glorious golden sunset out the bus.
Get Picture from Alice.

25€ turned into 35€ when we accepted the nightclub our taxi driver suggested
from the extensive list he browsed though on Instagram (while driving)
He lit a cigarette with the windows up (while driving)
sipping the beer he had at his knees (while driving).

We spent 10€ entry and had a glorious, wonderous, magical, ecstatic night dancing on the beach under a spotlit disco ball to some nice filthy house music.
(Pic)
The Montenegrian tax applied itself to the 10€ cover:
The taps in the bathroom sinks were disgusting and unsinkable, and tiny little waters cost 5 bucks

No Italian is in a relationship between 2&6am in the morning.
The heat made us both take our shirts off, and the XTC made us embrace sweatily.
Many boys were queueing up to have a chance to speak to her. One persistent chap seemed to be particularly adept at using google translate text.

With my shirt off, my phone was exposed, and a kind bloke gave me a warning:
Put your phone away.
There are theives about.

We danced until I began to see the sun rise in the mirror ball. Stunning vibes.
Afterwards a guy invites us to an afterparty in the forest: a "chill music party"
We are invited to smoke an enormous joint, which Dan and I puff down greedily.
Dan counters with an even enormouserier joint.
We get so blazed that I go forget to tell The Montenegrians how cool they all look - she had blue and gold glasses on, they were like mine but solid framed and they just looked so much better than mine.
The weed induced social paralysis kept me from hiding my envy with a compliment, and kept us docile enough to follow them out into the car park.

Outside, in the parking lot behind the nightclub, there was a pack of boys standing round a black Audi, its shine dimmed by a layer of grey dust from the winding (10 euro surcharge) gravel road.
One of them came up to us,
"Think of driving it in your story!" (Instagram of course, not what I tell you now)
"Flexing cool car!"
"It could be you bro"
We politely declined to get in the car decorated with 8 lads and several glittering necklaces.

Alice, la belle, had the majority of the 8 Audi boys begging her to come with them to their own private chill music party

"Come to the bushes" they said, "we have music and party"
The first two of our newly made friends disappeared into the forest.
bush bashing into the trees to show us the way to our promised "chill music party".
Our original host with the increasingly glasses remained to chaperone us.
"Why is there no trail that way?"
"Aw it's just round there."
Dan and Victoria put on their shoes.
"We'll just go for 5 minutes and then dip."
I grew up in Darwin. I've had my fair share of highly suspicious encounters.
"No, I want to walk on the beach." (stunning sunrise nature walk hello????)
We did not enter the forest.

# Watermelon

Our next challenger approached.
A tall beaming boy with Cassar like glasses walks over to me from the car, holding an enormous watermelon.
Hey bro, help us open our watermelon.

The lad is grinning at me.
Its not a nice grin.

Hold the watermelon he says.
Watermelons are full of water, weigh several kilos and would be tough to handle even if he passes it to me gently.

Taking the watermelon will require my arms, quads, and back to work together.
To take the watermelon, I must relinquish control of my entire body.
Forfeit freedom of my arms.
I will be helpless. Unarmed. Defenceless.

If I grab the watermelon I'm fucked.

I am wearing my trans blue and pink derby roller girls top (pre crop) and my favourite pink and blue slut shorts from Berlin. Flattering that I was considered the most in need of watermeloning.

[
The phone went underneath my shorts, and because of how fucking snatched I am, it pokes through in a big massive rectangle hung just on the belt line, in the perfect spot to be drawn quickly by my right hand.
I see him glance at it (fabricated memory)
] - this section is hypothetical really

Do you have a knife to open our watermelon?
Watermelons (and software engineers) are useless against a knife.
Their round green skull would spill all of its beautiful pink mush all over the pavement.

Suddenly I'm playing werewolves.
If they're friendly, I don't want them to know I'm suspicious. However as an honest citizen, (don't vote me off please), I had to ascertain the identity of their character through clever verbal sparring.
My master strategy, my grand plan:
I said "what?" Repeatedly
"Hold the watermelon."
"Who? huh? what?"
I didn't touch the watermelon.
"Do you have a knife to open our watermelon?"
"What?" Huh? What?"

He kept on having to repeat his question, incrementally simplifying it for me until finally he whittled down the sentence to it's purest and most sinister meaning.
"Do you have a knife?"

They must have just given up (I don't remember how the cycle ended), coz I did not touch that fucking nami bubble.

"I want to walk home on the beach."

I tested the decision by sticking my head out to the beach.
My god.
The bird flock floating across the soft sunrise colours, sang for me with a hundred wingbeats the sweetest house synth note I've ever heard

I walked back from the beach.
The boys in the car the were all eating delicious, fresh, pink, hydrating, sugar rush giving watermelon, and as I returned they laughed cruelly.
I was defeated, humiliated.
Noones party card had been revealed, but I am v good at mafia and trust my instincts.
To the godless clairvoyant (medic), intuition is divine.

Dan, the civilian, cast his vote to exit asap, swung by the promise of a joint on the beach.
So we were to beach walk.
However, Alice, sweet Alice, too kind to tell the 8 strange boys she wasnt going to go home with them, was entangled withing in their group.

Werewolves is a team sport. Victoria, the brave heroine, the medic, the saviour angel, la puta (crass Italians) made a game winning save. She walked into the fray, grabbed Alice by the arm and took us to the beach exit,
away from the forest, away from knives, away from the large group of boys wanting to take her home, towards 4 friends and a glorious beach sunrise.
Today, the butterfly beats into the sun.

On the way home she asked me about my life's philosophies
Be in the present, survive the anxiety of being.
So with 5 awful off the cuff attempts at poetically describing the beauty of what I saw and heard, I grounded myself (anti-anxiety technique). The survival instict afforded to me by my mild anxiety had done their job, and could rest.

Dan and Victoria trailed behind to be in eachothers company, and
Alice and I walked ahead, the determined hikers.
We discussed how beautiful it was to be alive in that moment, how beautiful the scene was.
She pointed out the twirling patterns the birds had printed in the sand with their feet.

We split, them to wisely take a taxi home, and me to stupidly walk along the beach with my adrenaline.
Without any money for the taxi, Dan robbed me with his favourite knife: "Please I'll pay you back"
he asked me for 50 bucks, so I gave him 32.60 and kept enough for the bus home and a delicious bevarage.

On the way home I ran 2.2k along the beach (in the process of as I write this.)
The town was this far away
[Here is a photo that shows how far away it is]

Eventually the Gorgeous scenery became beach chair farms
Freshly raked
Photo insert, play prophecies by philip glass
Stopped for a drink, got a coke at the first beach house on the way (keep fluids up im an athlete) like a disgusting economic imperialist
On the way out the large round shirtless and heavily moustached man referred to me as king instead of sir.
The modern monarchy has divine power by money, Gen Z has arrived as the new masters of the world.

The line between misery and glorious victory is incredibly fine.
So, instead of being brutally gutted and shoved in a bin to rot, my phone is in my hands. My canvas, my tool, my favourite easel.
I use the walk home to inscribe these words in its memory cells

I arrived at the Bus station at 8:30am with 7 euro 50
The lady has informed me that the next bus is at 10:30.
Time to get out the calculator.
Assuming it takes an hour for the bus to wind it's scenic tour, this will make my arrival time 11:30
On the family zoom there is a poll with options
5pm
6:30pm
7:30pm,
A nice Jackson early dinner
Converting with -8 hours we get
17-8 = 9am (Can you believe that? I bet this one is the herring put here to make the others more palatable/make me on time to)
18:30 - 8 = 10:30 am
And the final option:
19:30 - 8 = 11:30
11:30. Thats when my bus will arrive.
I'm going to make it to the zoom if it is this one.
I look back at the poll and blessfully
My younger, more innocent self just wanted a sleep in and selected this option.
His little digitized face, sitting above 7:30pm AEST is my promise:
I will make it to Naomi's birthday.

With my remaining money I have stopped by the shop, so I now return to Namaste hostel with 0 Dollars and an intact, unharmed watermelon.
Love you all,
See you soon.
Ben

My opening line shall be:
It's 11:30am, I shouldn't be awake.

The Food highlight of Montenegro:
Tea dipped watermelon
tea laced watermelon on the family call.

Everywheres closed for sunday the watermelon Fanciful wishing,

At the end of the night we were invited to a Montenegroian after party
Where we were to be charged the ultimate Montenegroian tax - a phone and a wallet each.
