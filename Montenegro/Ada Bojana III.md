The spell transfixed me too.
I was going to stay in Ulcinj, a nearby town.
However, as I arrived at the hostel, at the same time, my very own Dorian Gray walked in.
The first thing I noticed was a paperclip dragonfly dangling from his locks.

Slightly taller than me at 19

He told me I was hot with a "you have a good complexion for hitchhiking"

He had hitchiked all the way from Istanbul to Ulcinj.
He had an air of naive youthfullness about him, so bright and excited to see the world.
The original song he serenaded us with was about the little beautiful things in the world - the buzzing of a bumblebee etc. Seeing the mirror held up to me this close was confronting.
He so joyously proclaimed all I preach, I wonder if he also has mild anxiety.
He was so excited to be alive. Wow the joy. Where has mine gone.

He wore a stud in his right ear and loved to skinny dip. I did not
On parting we had the longest hug of my whole trip - I think it even longer than Emma (not in overall goodbye sequence, just in hug length).

Matej also contacted me to say my phone had washed up on the beach. My drowned son, dead from my inattention, had reappeared as a corpse. The only card remaining was my student ID. Im literally not even a student anymore.
After a week of hunting, my deus ex machina had arrived. The SIM card still worked and I was able to retrieve my whatsapp backup with Emmas contact on it.
