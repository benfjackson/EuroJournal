Da Saga de Ada Bojana
Return to Ada Bojana

I very nearly stayed 2 weeks in the forest of Ada Bojana.
Ada Bojana enchants its visitors with a spell.
Those who hear its song never leave. They return, year upon year, migrating from Belgrade to (
) live in the
All who fall under it whisper to others, luring them to the eternal shores.
It is intoxicating

## Setting

Campsite
The campsite had horrific vibes.
I was in a hammock, and was hung between two trees above a creeping abyss of thorny vines. Used shit tickets were metres away, and I was too scared of them to do anything about it.
It was surrounded by 3 different bars, so rotating my head let me choose between the radio stations. I had 1 party for each ear and a spare.
The week before when I was visiting, I was sad that the music stopped at 6am. How quickly feelings change.
Luckily I remembered my earplugs, which I barely took out for the whole week.

River
The river flowed really strongly, filled with cold water. Swimming at a good click, I could manage to stay adjacent with my pile of stuff resting on the beach.

Restaurants
One of the restaurants was family owned and did a lovely seafood risotto, with fresh, meaty, fatty squid and inky black squid dye wasnt even needed to turn my (recovering bowels) shit black.

Dom Kulture
Dom Kulture means the Home of Culture. It wasn't Montenegronian culture, but the culture of life itself.

The music was a blend of rare and exotic sounds from all corners of the globe. They transmit their vibes out into the universe on the radio station Radio Skadar.

Dance floor
The floor itself was planked wood, rough but comfortable underfoot, weathered by the thousands of feet that had sanded it down to the rhythms of the night.
dance powered sander
writhing mass of bodies feeling the music and moving along with it.
Room full of people hippy dancing, not a care in the world. Dancing like this in a pack changed the vibe to become more expressive than attention seeky.
ofc i it boyd the df (for the nth time this trip)

Vibe absolutely inexplainable. Everyone was smiling all the time, always saying hi for a chat. Didn't need to know them, never had to have met them. Eye contact and a smile off the bat. Huge juxtaposition with the hostels I had come from and gone to.
Everyone was happy, which lifted you into an ecstatic state.
I was absolutely glowing after having left. My food was sweeter, the things I saw more visually interesting.

## Characters

Kod Pesa owners
The only public wifi for several hours was in a family run restaurant called Kod Pesha.
On our first night we went here for a grill, which was delicious
They were all born in the wake of the Yugoslavian breakup wars.

He thought I was Serbian due to my proximity to the 3 yungfullas.

- Matej conceived in the weeks following the Belgrade bombings.
  The Montenegrian Men who ran the restaurant were of fighting age from that era.
  None of them liked us.

I went for a coffee and a shit a couple mornings there, always recieving dirty looks
The elderly patriarch knocked me out of the toilet one day and gave me a spray in Montenegrian. He'd be damned if he was gonna let a Serbian shit in his toilet.

Hegel Man in the Hat

- option 3, "I write when the writing comes from me."
  "are you here doing soul searching?"
  "there is wisdom in the great infinity of the sea"

Matej
HEDONISM tattooed in bold cyrilic across his chest.
Moustached and mulleted.
Great vibes eminate from this man. Big, joyful laugh that he uses to skillfully pick out an entertaining piece of your story.
Funny guy, I couldnt follow the Serbian conversations, but I could always understand his laugh.
Born in the 2 weeks following Belgrade bombing. Is the spirit of 'fuck it, the world will end anyway lets fucken do it'
Even when he is feeling low you can see he puts in the effort to wear a smile.

Despite Montenegronian being the official language of Montenegro, Serbians firmly asserted that Serbian was the language that was spoken there. (Serbian is recognised alongside - and the montenegrian i asked about it said same shit same smell)

Owner of Dom Kulture
This guy was cool. Long hair, long beard, always smiling, rarely wearing clothes.
Coolest mf ever

Gizmo & Igor

My Saviour in the Floral Shirt

Heroin couple
always domesticing - horrific vibes

# FOOD POISONING

\*This is a rewriting of this story.\*

Drunk, high and a little hungry, a peach off the ground as a bedtime snack seemed like a good idea at the time. (Liv questioned me about why I flirted with her moments after I wrote this sentence)
When I woke up the heroin couple was getting ready to leave. The goodbye they got from me was spraying my stomachs contents into the vines of the jungle (parallel).
When all the food had gone, my soul (carefully curated gut biome) leaked out of me, where it lay on the ground glistening and golden.
The day was brutal. My body rejected anything and everything I fed it.
All I could manage was lying on the sand and listening to The Necklace.
With no cupboard with a top shelf lime juice cordial, I stupidly did not drink any juice. This meant that I woke the following day with a bursting rectum and a few drops that had snuck past the night watchman.
My master plan was: toilet -> coca cola at Dom Kulture
I stood up and my vision tunneled,
A few steps were all I could manage before falling to my knees, head spinning.
My blood sugar was critically low.
I fell forward and passed out.
While I was out, someone shat my pants for me. Now my ass was no longer bursting, which was nice.
As I came to, I realised that the 50m to Dom kulture was now unfathomably far and the techno bar I was sleeping next to that had been tormenting me nightly was now my only hope.
Both my vision and my entire being had become fuzzy.
Survival instict kicked in, and I crawled, towards the techno and towards salvation.
Crawl
Crawl
Pass out
I made it to the road.
Indomitable, I crawled.
Crawl
crawl
pass out.

Here, I died, and it was nothingness. Not like the half being that is sleep, there was nothing.
I have no idea how long I was lying there before I came to.

No cars must have come along the road, because each time I passed out, I woke up alive.

They all thought I had been doing drugs, and offered me some when I said I hadnt.

I died in Ada Bojana.

Glass by glass, I bought and drank their entire stock of lemonade.

The following days were like I had been reborn
