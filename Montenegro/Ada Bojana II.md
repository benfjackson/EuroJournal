Da Saga de Ada Bojana
Return to Ada Bojana

I very nearly stayed 2 weeks in the forest of Ada Bojana.
Ada Bojana enchants its visitors with a spell.
Those who hear its song never leave. They return, year upon year, migrating from Belgrade to (
) live in the
All who fall under it whisper to others, luring them to the eternal shores.
It is intoxicating

## Setting

Campsite
The campsite had horrific vibes.
I was in a hammock, and was hung between two trees above a creeping abyss of thorny vines. Used shit tickets were metres away, and I was too scared of them to do anything about it.
It was surrounded by 3 different bars, so rotating my head let me choose between the radio stations. I had 1 party for each ear and a spare.
The week before when I was visiting, I was sad that the music stopped at 6am. How quickly feelings change.
Luckily I remembered my earplugs, which I barely took out for the whole week.

River
The river flowed really strongly, filled with cold water. Swimming at a good click, I could manage to stay adjacent with my pile of stuff resting on the beach.

Restaurants
One of the restaurants was family owned and did a lovely seafood risotto, with fresh, meaty, fatty squid and inky black squid dye wasnt even needed to turn my (recovering bowels) shit black.

Dom Kulture
Dom Kulture means the Home of Culture. It wasn't Montenegronian culture, but the culture of life itself.

The music was a blend of rare and exotic sounds from all corners of the globe. They transmit their vibes out into the universe on the radio station Radio Skadar.

Dance floor
The floor itself was planked wood, rough but comfortable underfoot, weathered by the thousands of feet that had sanded it down to the rhythms of the night.
dance powered sander
writhing mass of bodies feeling the music and moving along with it.
Room full of people hippy dancing, not a care in the world. Dancing like this in a pack changed the vibe to become more expressive than attention seeky.
ofc i it boyd the df (for the nth time this trip)

Vibe absolutely inexplainable. Everyone was smiling all the time, always saying hi for a chat. Didn't need to know them, never had to have met them. Eye contact and a smile off the bat. Huge juxtaposition with the hostels I had come from and gone to.
Everyone was happy, which lifted you into an ecstatic state.
I was absolutely glowing after having left. My food was sweeter, the things I saw more visually interesting.

## Characters

Kod Pesa owners
The only public wifi for several hours was in a family run restaurant called Kod Pesha.
On our first night we went here for a grill, which was delicious
They were all born in the wake of the Yugoslavian breakup wars.

He thought I was Serbian due to my proximity to the 3 yungfullas.

- Matej conceived in the weeks following the Belgrade bombings.
  The Montenegrian Men who ran the restaurant were of fighting age from that era.
  None of them liked us.

I went for a coffee and a shit a couple mornings there, always recieving dirty looks
The elderly patriarch knocked me out of the toilet one day and gave me a spray in Montenegrian. He'd be damned if he was gonna let a Serbian shit in his toilet.

Matej
HEDONISM tattooed in bold cyrilic across his chest.
Moustached and mulleted.
Great vibes eminate from this man. Big, joyful laugh that he uses to skillfully pick out an entertaining piece of your story.
Funny guy, I couldnt follow the Serbian conversations, but I could always understand his laugh.
Born in the 2 weeks following Belgrade bombing. Is the spirit of 'fuck it, the world will end anyway lets fucken do it'
Even when he is feeling low you can see he puts in the effort to wear a smile.

Despite Montenegronian being the official language of Montenegro, Serbians firmly asserted that Serbian was the language that was spoken there. (Serbian is recognised alongside - and the montenegrian i asked about it said same shit same smell)

This guy was cool. Long hair, long beard, always smiling, rarely wearing clothes.
Coolest mf ever

# FOOD POISONING

Drunk, high and a little hungry, a peach off the ground as a bedtime snack seemed like a good idea at the time.
When I woke up the heroin couple was getting ready to leave. To say goodbye, I sprayed my stomachs contents across the vines of the jungle.
I vomited the peach, the yoghurt, my incinvibility, until there was nothing left, whence the gut biome I have so carefully curated was thrown to the ground.
My soul died before me, a glistening golden puddle torn from my body to lie terrified on the jungle floor.

The day was brutal. My body rejected anything and everything I fed it, and all I could manage was lying on the sand and listening to The Necklace, my scathing critiques forgotten as it became my only comfort in the world.

With no easy access to a cupboard's top shelf hiding delicious lime juice cordial from sugar deprived children, I did not keep my blood sugar up.

I went to sleep hungry and woozy, to wake the following day with a bursting rectum and a few drops that had snuck past the night watchman.
Lying in my hammock, a master plan came to me: toilet, coca cola and a swim.

However, with each of the 3 steps I took towards Dom Kulture, my vision closed on me, tunneling, forcing me to my knees, then pushing me forward to pass out in the dirt.
My blood sugar was critically low.

Upon coming to I was incredibly weak and lightheaded – I tried to stand and failed.
The 50m to Dom kulture was now unfathomably far.
The techno bar I was sleeping next to, the bar that had been tormenting me nightly with its annoyingly good annoyingly late music, was now my only hope.

Only the most severe cases of hypoglycemia can lead to a loss of conciousness, and without quick action, can lead to a coma or death.
I could feel the threat I was under, so I crawled.

My adventure could not end here. I have a life to return to in Aus, family, friends, all so far away on the other side of the world.
Dying of food poisoning in the jungles of Ada Bojana is the equivalent of elvis going out on the toilet, and I refuse to let this happen.
Indomitable, I crawled.

I made it to the road.
Crawl
crawl
pass out.
No cars must have come along the road, because each time I passed out, I woke up alive.
While I was out, someone (not me) had shat my pants. Now my ass was no longer bursting, which was nice, but my pants were full of shit that ran down my legs, mushed my socks and seeped into the black Brooks I had proudly worn to KitKat, which wasn't nice.

Dirt, techno, shat pants and half concious crawling had become my universe, the only thing I had ever done, and the singular focus of my being.
Towards the thumping bassline and towards salvation.
Crawl
Crawl
Pass out.

Finally, after the 15 longest metres ever, I crawled into the entrance of the bar.
Here, I died, and it was nothingness.
This was not the half being that is sleep, this was pure nothingness. I was not.

I have no idea how long I was lying there before I was resurrected with a gasp by a gruff angel in a floral beach shirt holding an emptied glass of water.
"Have you taken any drugs?" he asked.
He offered me some when I said I hadnt - XTC would give me the energy boost I needed.
I declined.
A good Christian, the cold splash of holy water had promised me a second chance at life, so I sat squelchingly down at the bar.

There, in their fridge, I spied it, that beautiful sugary commodity, the golden elixir, ambrosia, the nectar of eternal life – lemonade.
Glass by glass, I bought and drank their entire stock.

2.  It was to rain that night, rendering my hammock unsleepable, so from a cosy comfortable seat in Dom Kulture, I watched the dance floor undulate with its writhing battlefield of hippies and wrote this story.

The following days were like I had been reborn
